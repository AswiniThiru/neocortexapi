Native desktop and mobile applications can be created by C# and XAML developers using a cross-platform framework called.NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI). Microsoft is the company behind
 its development. Using.NET MAUI, it is used to construct apps that run on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and iOS from a single shared codebase. Simplifying the process of creating and 
managing applications for many platforms is the primary aim.

Xamarin is evaluated by.NET MAUI.To increase performance, forms were expanded from mobile to desktop contexts and the basic user interface controls were rewritten. It shares a lot of 
similarities with Xamarin Forms, another framework that allows you make cross-platform apps with only one codebase. Developing as much of your app's functionality and UI design as you can
 in a single project is the main objective of.NET MAUI.Additionally, it supports.NET hot reload, which allows you to make changes to the source code while the programme operating.This is 
the main developer Integrated Development Environment. 

Introduction to SDR
Pentti Kanerva developed the mathematical structure of human long-term memory known as sparse distributed memory (SDM) in 1988 while he was employed at NASA Ames Research Centre.
Both in theory and in experiments, this memory demonstrates behaviours that are similar to those that have not yet been achieved by machines, such as quick identification of faces or smells,
the ability to make new connections between seemingly unrelated concepts, etc. Large volumes of information can be stored and retrieved using sparse distributed memory, which prioritises
similarity above precision. Robot navigation and experience-based robot manipulation have seen several recent applications.A mathematical model of human memory known as sparse distributed 
memory makes use of high-dimensional space to simulate the vast amounts of memory seen in a human brain network.

With the exception of the address and data word lengths, the memory is similar to standard computer memory. As we shall see in a moment, it is a generalised random-access memory for lengthy
words, and its structure and behaviour are explicable in terms of a standard random-access memory. First, let's take a look at an average random-access memory.Similar to this, the internal
structure of sparse distributed memory is an array of addressable storage places with a set capacity. It is not feasible to construct a hardware location, or hard location, for every one of
the 2N addresses due to the length of the addresses. (In light of the immense capacity that such a memory would have, it is also not necessary.)

This idea is closely related to theories regarding the representation and processing of information in the brain, namely in the neocortex.According to the theory known as Sparse Dispersed 
Representation, the brain employs a dispersed and sparse coding technique as opposed to a one-to-one mapping between individual neurons and particular concepts or properties. With this 
method, most neurons stay dormant while a tiny fraction becomes active inorder to reflect a specific idea or information.It is believed that this sparse and scattered pattern of 
activation has various benefits, such as fault tolerance, resilience, and generalizability to various inputs. It is a fundamental idea in certain theories of how neural networks performs in a 
network, including those that deal with memory formation in the neocortex and hierarchical procesS.

Artificial neural networks struggle with continuous learning, an issue that biological neural networks can handle with ease. Expanding upon previous work that connected a powerful 
Transformer model with a core neural circuit via Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM), we develop a modified Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) that demonstrates strong ongoing learning capabilities.
Also discovered that each element of our MLP variation, which we translated from biology, is essential for lifelong learning. Additionally, our approach does not contain any task information or
memory replay, and it presents new techniques for sparse network training that might be used in numerous different contexts.It offers an extensive feature set and tool set for developing
 cross-platform apps. You may use Visual Studio's extensive ecosystem to create and debug your MAUI 
apps for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.
