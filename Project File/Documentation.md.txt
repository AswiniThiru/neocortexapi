A cross-platform framework called .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) allows C# and XAML developers to create native mobile and desktop  applications. It is developed by Microsoft. It is 
used to create apps with a single shared codebase that work on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and iOS by using.NET MAUI.The main goal is to simplify the process of developing and maintaining
application across multiple platforms.  

Introduction to SDR

This idea is linked to theories regarding the representation and processing of information in the brain, namely in the neocortex.According to the theory known as Sparse Dispersed 
Representation, the brain employs a dispersed and sparse coding technique as opposed to a one-to-one mapping between individual neurons and particular concepts or properties. With this 
method, most neurons stay dormant while a tiny fraction becomes active inorder to reflect a specific idea or information.It is believed that this sparse and scattered pattern of 
activation has various benefits, such as fault tolerance, resilience, and generalizability to various inputs. It is a fundamental idea in certain theories of how neural networks work, 
including those that deal with memory formation in the neocortex and hierarchical processing.
