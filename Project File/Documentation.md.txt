A cross-platform framework called .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) allows C# and XAML developers to create native mobile and desktop  applications. It is developed by Microsoft. It is 
used to create apps with a single shared codebase that work on Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and iOS by using.NET MAUI.The main goal is to simplify the process of developing and maintaining
application across multiple platforms.  

Introduction to SDR

This idea is closely related to theories regarding the representation and processing of information in the brain, namely in the neocortex.According to the theory known as Sparse Dispersed 
Representation, the brain employs a dispersed and sparse coding technique as opposed to a one-to-one mapping between individual neurons and particular concepts or properties. With this 
method, most neurons stay dormant while a tiny fraction becomes active inorder to reflect a specific idea or information.It is believed that this sparse and scattered pattern of 
activation has various benefits, such as fault tolerance, resilience, and generalizability to various inputs. It is a fundamental idea in certain theories of how neural networks work, 
including those that deal with memory formation in the neocortex and hierarchical procesS.

Artificial neural networks struggle with continuous learning, an issue that biological neural networks can handle with ease. Expanding upon previous work that connected a powerful 
Transformer model with a core neural circuit via Sparse Distributed Memory (SDM), we develop a modified Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) that demonstrates strong ongoing learning capabilities.
Also discovered that each element of our MLP variation, which we translated from biology, is essential for lifelong learning. Additionally, our approach does not contain any task information or
memory replay, and it presents new techniques for sparse network training that might be used in numerous different contexts.
