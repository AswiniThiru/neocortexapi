hi i am starting my project
I'll document all the steps here..

1. forking the neocorteapi and creating my own branch and a group branch
2. cloning the repo into local machine
3. Using Visual studio create a MAUI app 
4. Change the default output settings to a andriod or iphone and run the Main program
5. now open the phone and check the created app
6. make some changes to the app to see the difference and play around..


----> currently doing research on the UI proposals for the project

-----> also working on Python file for understanding the user inputs 

MAUI.graphics library can be used to generate maui apps and different outputs...
