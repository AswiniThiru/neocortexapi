To implement the SDR representation in the MAUI application using the Maui.Graphics library and integrate the drawing functionality into the 'NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib' library, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Python Script**:
   Review the provided Python script `draw_figure.py` to understand its functionality. This script takes command-line arguments to generate a visualization of SDR (Sparse Distributed Representation) using Plotly library.

2. **Translate Python Code to C#**:
   You'll need to rewrite the functionality of `draw_figure.py` in C# using the Maui.Graphics library for drawing. This will involve understanding how to create plots, configure axes, draw rectangles, etc., which are all functionalities provided by Maui.Graphics.

3. **Integrate with MAUI Application**:
   Integrate the C# code into your MAUI application. This involves creating appropriate UI elements to input command-line arguments such as filename, graph name, max cycles, etc., and then triggering the SDR visualization based on these inputs.

4. **Implement SDR Drawing in NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib**:
   Extend or modify the `NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib` library to include the functionality for drawing SDR representations using Maui.Graphics. This might involve creating new classes or methods to encapsulate the drawing logic.

Here's a general outline of how you can proceed with the implementation:

- **UI Design**:
  Design the UI for your MAUI application to accept the required command-line arguments. Use appropriate controls such as textboxes, dropdowns, etc., to gather input from the user.

- **Integration with Maui.Graphics**:
  Use Maui.Graphics to create the visualization of the SDR. You'll need to create graphics objects to represent axes, rectangles for active cells, labels, etc.

- **Parameter Passing**:
  Once the user inputs the required parameters through the UI, pass these parameters to the SDR drawing functionality.

- **Error Handling**:
  Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid inputs or runtime errors gracefully.

- **Testing**:
  Thoroughly test your application with various inputs to ensure correctness and robustness.

- **Documentation**:
  Document your code properly, including comments and documentation strings, to make it understandable to other developers.

- **Optimization**:
  Optimize your code for performance and efficiency, especially if dealing with large datasets or complex visualizations.
