NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib

Description
NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib is a C# library that provides functionality to plot activity data from a sample file using OxyPlot library. It reads data from a text file, processes it, and generates plots either horizontally or vertically based on the provided arguments.


Usage
To use this library, follow these steps:

Ensure you have the required NuGet packages installed. This project relies on OxyPlot for plotting functionality. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using NuGet Package Manager.

Include the NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib namespace in your C# code file.



Project Description:

In this project, our team will be developing a .Net Multi-platform App UI and there will be an interface where we will feed the SDR values from either Spatial pool or Multisequence learning and there will be an interface where we can see the SDR output image.

Application Scenario:

The goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze SDR images seamlessly across different devices and platforms.

Features:

1) Compatibility:
	The MAUI app should be compatible with multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, ensuring accessibility for a diverse user base.

2) SDR Data Import:
	Allow users to import SDR data files easily, supporting various formats commonly used in remote sensing applications.

3) Data Export:
	Provide options for exporting processed SDR images in standard formats, enabling users to share results with colleagues or incorporate them into reports.


Development Timeline:

1) Design and Prototyping:
	Develop a user interface design and create interactive prototypes for feedback and validation.

2) Development:
	Implement the core functionalities of the MAUI app, focusing on cross-platform compatibility and efficient SDR image visualization.

3) Testing:
	Conduct rigorous testing, including functional, performance, and security testing, to ensure the app meets high-quality standards.
