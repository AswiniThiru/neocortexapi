Project Description:

In this project, our team will be developing a .Net Multi-platform App UI and there will be an interface where we will feed the SDR values from either Spatial pool or Multisequence learning and there will be an interface where we can see the SDR output image.

Application Scenario:

The goal of this application is to provide a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze SDR images seamlessly across different devices and platforms.

Features:

1) Compatibility:
	The MAUI app should be compatible with multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, ensuring accessibility for a diverse user base.

2) SDR Data Import:
	Allow users to import SDR data files easily, supporting various formats commonly used in remote sensing applications.

3) Data Export:
	Provide options for exporting processed SDR images in standard formats, enabling users to share results with colleagues or incorporate them into reports.
