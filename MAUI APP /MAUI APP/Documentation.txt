To implement the SDR representation in the MAUI application using the Maui.Graphics library and integrate the drawing functionality into the 'NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib' library, you need to follow these steps:

Understand the Python Script:
Review the provided Python script draw_figure.py to understand its functionality. This script takes command-line arguments to generate a visualization of SDR (Sparse Distributed Representation) using Plotly library.
Translate Python Code to C#:
You'll need to rewrite the functionality of draw_figure.py in C# using the Maui.Graphics library for drawing. This will involve understanding how to create plots, configure axes, draw rectangles, etc., which are all functionalities provided by Maui.Graphics.
Integrate with MAUI Application:
Integrate the C# code into your MAUI application. This involves creating appropriate UI elements to input command-line arguments such as filename, graph name, max cycles, etc., and then triggering the SDR visualization based on these inputs.
Implement SDR Drawing in NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib:
Extend or modify the NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib library to include the functionality for drawing SDR representations using Maui.Graphics. This might involve creating new classes or methods to encapsulate the drawing logic.
Here's a general outline of how you can proceed with the implementation:

UI Design:
Design the UI for your MAUI application to accept the required command-line arguments. Use appropriate controls such as textboxes, dropdowns, etc., to gather input from the user.
Integration with Maui.Graphics:
Use Maui.Graphics to create the visualization of the SDR. You'll need to create graphics objects to represent axes, rectangles for active cells, labels, etc.
Parameter Passing:
Once the user inputs the required parameters through the UI, pass these parameters to the SDR drawing functionality.
Error Handling:
Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid inputs or runtime errors gracefully.
Testing:
Thoroughly test your application with various inputs to ensure correctness and robustness.
Documentation:
Document your code properly, including comments and documentation strings, to make it understandable to other developers.
Optimization:
Optimize your code for performance and efficiency, especially if dealing with large datasets or complex visualizations.
