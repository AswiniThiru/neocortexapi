ML22/23-8 Implement the SDR representation in the MAUI application.
The NeocortexApi framework provides a Python script draw_figure.py that renders an SDR. Any SDR can be represented in 2D using a script described in this document.
Your Task is to implement a simple MAUI application that uses the library Maui.Graphics, to draw the same or similar SDR as produced by the Python script draw_figure.py.
All command line arguments from the script should be entered in the MAU application by using the UI. In addition, the drawing functionality must be implemented in the ‘NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib’ library.





To implement the SDR representation in the MAUI application using the Maui.Graphics library and integrate the drawing functionality into the 'NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib' library, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Python Script**:
   Review the provided Python script `draw_figure.py` to understand its functionality. This script takes command-line arguments to generate a visualization of SDR (Sparse Distributed Representation) using Plotly library.
   ---> create UI elements to provide the input through textboxes, buttons, dropdowns for the below inputs

   Certainly! Each input component corresponds to a specific aspect of the plot or the data being visualized. Here's an explanation of each input component: Considering the example of python file

          1. `<filename>`: This is the path to the file containing the data to be plotted. In this case, it's `sampleOne.txt`.
          
          2. `<graphename>`: This represents the name of the graph or plot. It's typically used for labeling purposes. In the provided example, it's `"test1"`.
          
          3. `<maxcycles>`: This is an integer representing the maximum number of cycles or iterations. It determines the length of the x-axis or the number of data points along the x-axis. In the example, it's `19`.
          
          4. `<highlighttouch>`: This is an integer representing the number of highlighted touches. It could indicate a specific point or range of interest within the data. In the example, it's `8`.
          
          5. `<yaxistitle>`: This is a string representing the title of the y-axis. It describes the data represented along the y-axis. In the example, it's `"yaxis"`.
          
          6. `<xaxistitle>`: This is a string representing the title of the x-axis. It describes the data represented along the x-axis. In the example, it's `"xaxis"`.
          
          7. `<mincellrange>`: This is an optional input representing the minimum range of the cells. It's used to specify the lower bound of the y-axis or the data range. In the example, it's `50`.
          
          8. `<maxcellrange>`: This is an optional input representing the maximum range of the cells. It's used to specify the upper bound of the y-axis or the data range. In the example, it's `4000`.
          
          9. `<subplottitle>`: This is a string representing the title of the subplot. It provides additional context or information about the plot or the data being visualized. In the example, it's `"single column"`.
          
          10. `<figurename>`: This is a string representing the name of the figure. It's typically used for labeling or identification purposes. In the example, it's `"CortialColumn"`.
          
          11. `-a` (optional): This is a flag indicating that cells are placed on the desired x-axis instead of the default y-axis. It's optional and may or may not be included depending on the specific requirements of the plot.
          
          These input components collectively define the parameters of the plot and the data to be visualized, enabling the C# program to generate the plot accordingly.

   Input in python code : python draw_figure.py -fn sampleOne.txt -gn test1 -mc 19 -ht 8 -yt yaxis -xt xaxis -min 50 -max 4000 -st 'single column' -fign CortialColumn -a
   Input i C# code : draw_figure.exe sampleOne.txt test1 19 8 yaxis xaxis 50 4000 "single column" CortialColumn -a

3. **Translate Python Code to C#**:
   You'll need to rewrite the functionality of `draw_figure.py` in C# using the Maui.Graphics library for drawing. This will involve understanding how to create plots, configure axes, draw rectangles, etc., which are all functionalities provided by Maui.Graphics.

4. **Integrate with MAUI Application**:
   Integrate the C# code into your MAUI application. This involves creating appropriate UI elements to input command-line arguments such as filename, graph name, max cycles, etc., and then triggering the SDR visualization based on these inputs.

5. **Implement SDR Drawing in NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib**:
   Extend or modify the `NeocortexApi.SdrDrawerLib` library to include the functionality for drawing SDR representations using Maui.Graphics. This might involve creating new classes or methods to encapsulate the drawing logic.

Here's a general outline of how you can proceed with the implementation:

- **UI Design**:
  Design the UI for your MAUI application to accept the required command-line arguments. Use appropriate controls such as textboxes, dropdowns, etc., to gather input from the user.

- **Integration with Maui.Graphics**:
  Use Maui.Graphics to create the visualization of the SDR. You'll need to create graphics objects to represent axes, rectangles for active cells, labels, etc.

- **Parameter Passing**:
  Once the user inputs the required parameters through the UI, pass these parameters to the SDR drawing functionality.

- **Error Handling**:
  Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with invalid inputs or runtime errors gracefully.

- **Testing**:
  Thoroughly test your application with various inputs to ensure correctness and robustness.

- **Documentation**:
  Document your code properly, including comments and documentation strings, to make it understandable to other developers.

- **Optimization**:
  Optimize your code for performance and efficiency, especially if dealing with large datasets or complex visualizations.
